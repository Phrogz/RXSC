## TODO

* <invoke>
* Why doesn't going to action-3 via action.done kill the interpreter?
* Catch Datamodel runtime errors and raise errors in the machine
* Follow up on whether single `<scxml>` state should be allowed or not
* Provide outside hooks for watching state changes


## OPEN NOTES/QUESTIONS (not intended to be easily interpreted by mortals)

* grandparent might be nil; isParallelState() must accept nil values and return false

* Why must params have an expression in addition to a name, and what context are they evaluated/set in?

* Why are `<data>` id instead of ncname; this requires the data variables to be uniquely distinct from state ids.

* Strongly dislike the red text and huge anchors?
